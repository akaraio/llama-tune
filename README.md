# llama-tune

The code loads a dataset from a file using load_dataset and formats the prompts for text generation by applying a template to each conversation. It then trains a large language model on the formatted prompts using SFTTrainer, which uses a mix of model parallelism and quantization to optimize performance. The code also merges and unloads the model, which is then used to make predictions on new input.
